# Corsair Lighting Protocol Boards
Arduino board definitions for use with the [Corsair Lighting Protocol](https://github.com/Legion2/CorsairLightingProtocol) library.
These board definitions have modified USB settings so they can be used to simulate corsair devices.

## Install CLP Boards in Arduino
All boards can simply be installed in Arduino IDE via the Boards Manager.
When using 3rd party boards such as SparkFun you must install them additionally.
See [Supported Hardware Boards](#supported-hardware-boards) down below for more details.

package index URL:
```
